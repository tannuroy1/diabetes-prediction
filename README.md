# diabetes-prediction
This Python code is related to a machine learning project using the diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv). The goal appears to be predicting the onset of diabetes (the Outcome column) based on other features in the dataset. Here's a description of the major steps in the code:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame (df).
Data Exploration:
df.plot(kind='density', subplots=True, layout=(3,3), sharex=False): This code generates density plots for each feature in the dataset.
df.isnull().sum(): Checks for missing values in the dataset.
df.describe(): Provides summary statistics for each numerical feature in the dataset.
df.Outcome.value_counts(): Counts the number of instances for each value in the Outcome column.
Data Preprocessing:
LabelEncoder() is used to convert the Outcome column to numerical values (0 or 1).
Feature Scaling:
StandardScaler() is used to scale the feature values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Model Training:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
DecisionTreeClassifier, BaggingClassifier, and RandomForestClassifier are used for training the model.
Model Evaluation:
cross_val_score() is used to evaluate the models using cross-validation.
Overall, the code demonstrates the process of loading, exploring, preprocessing, training, and evaluating a machine learning model for predicting diabetes onset based on the provided dataset.
